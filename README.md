# React Neighborhood Project

This is a react project and it is part of Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course. It showcases dealing with different APIs. I used google maps and wunderground for this project. 

It shows 5 different dance venues in singapore, which is for different dancestyles. User can search any dancestyle and see the venues. When user clicks on one of the venues an infowindow pops up with some info about the venue and weather forecast of the day the next event will be. As singapore is a tropical country it can get showers, so this is to predict this.

To use this website,

- First clone the project  
- Then npm install dependencies  
- and nmp start to start it
